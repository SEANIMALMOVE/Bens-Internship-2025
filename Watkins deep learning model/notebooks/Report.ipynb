    "This project examines the application of deep learning methods for audio classification using spectrogram-based representations. Audio signals are transformed into **mel-spectrograms** and treated as image-like inputs for convolutional neural networks. Two modeling approaches are implemented and compared: a custom **baseline** Convolutional Neural Network trained from scratch and a transfer learning model based on **EfficientNet-B0** pretrained on ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are trained using a **supervised learning** setup with separate training, validation, and test datasets. Validation is employed for model selection and early stopping, while final performance is assessed on a test set. Evaluation is conducted using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, loss, precision, recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the project is to analyze the performance difference between a simple baseline architecture and a pretrained deep model, and to assess the effectiveness of transfer learning for spectrogram-based audio classification tasks.\n",

Each sample is shaped into channel-first shape, then padded or cropped to a fixed width (400 time frames) so the network receives equally shaped inputs. The dataset also builds a class_to_idx mapping from sorted class folder names; the dataloaders are created with configurable batching and multiprocessing options for training and evaluation."
